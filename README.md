## Linear Regression Models

This repository contains two linear regression models trained on a dataset.

### Models
1. **Model 1:** Uses one of the `X` that fits the best as the only feature to predict `y`.
2. **Model 2:** Uses `X1` and `X2` as features to predict `y`.

### Performance Comparison
- **Model 1 (X1 only):** Provides a baseline model with a certain Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Model 2 (X1 & X2):** Introduces another variable, aiming to reduce the error.

### Versioning
- The first model (`linear_model_x1.pkl`) is the initial version.
- The second model (`linear_model_x1_x2.pkl`) is the current version, with improvements in prediction accuracy.
